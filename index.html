		<h1 class="things">Things that make Chief awesome</h1>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="span6">
				<h3>It's so easy</h3>
				<p>With just under 20 files, Chief is stripped of all
				superfluous content that you probably wouldn't use
				anyways. A simple set of commands and guidelines
				are enough to make your life easier. With a structure
				this small, you'll learn the ins and outs in no time.</p>
				<p>Creating your app is intuitive and fast. The file
				structure is simple: everything you create is a module.
				A module has a controller, and it can contain multiple views
				and models. Modules are stored in <code>modules/</code>. In addition to modules, Chief stores the important
				stuff in <code>system/</code>, plugins in <code>plugins/</code>
				and your layout in <code>layout/</code>.</p>
				<p>
					Chief includes an install script that creates the
					required database structure for you. Installing takes
					under a minute from clicking the Download button above
					to being greeted by a lovely Hello World message.
				</p>
				<hr class="soften">
				<h3>It's blazing fast and light as a feather</h3>
				<p>
					Because Chief if is void of useless stuff and has
					only the files you really, really need, performance
					tends to be pretty good. With under 20 files, deploying
					is effortless.
				</p>
				<p>
					Chief weighs only 14kb. With an codebase this small,
					we just haven't been able to fit that many bugs in. That's
					a shame, but it also means that you'll spend more time coding
					your app than dodging malfunctioning parts.
				</p>
				<hr class="soften">
				<h3>It's extensible</h3>
				<p>
					Because of its simplicity, Chief can be easily extended.
					The most obvious way is to add modules, but you can also
					create plugins and add external libraries. For more advanced
					hackers, feel free to take a stab at the core files &ndash;
					they're designed to allow that.
				</p>
				<p>
					Chief is by no means a ready framework. You make it your
					own. It allows you to do the basic stuff just fine, but
					when you need something a bit more specialized, you are
					the one who knows best how to do it, not the framework.
					Chief just helps you do it easier.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the past, Chief has been used to create multidomain
					environments, run a distributed CMS, power an enterprise
					class bookkeeping software, and much more. Chief poses no
					restrictions to what you can build.
				</p>
				<hr class="soften">
				<h3>It's helpful</h3>
				<p>
					Chief has tools to make your life easier. Built in notification
					system and a set of often needed functions help you make
					cooler apps faster.
				</p>
				<p>
					Chief also handles image resizing and caching automatically.
					No matter how you store your images, when they are requested through
					Chief, you can add parameters at the end of the file to affect
					the output. Requesting <em>IMG_5324.jpg?800x600C</em> automatically resizes
					the image to 800 by 600 pixels, cropping the overflowing parts out.
					The result is cached, so this image needs to be generated only once.
					Pretty damn great, right?
				</p>
				<p>
					Chief also includes Twitter Bootstrap to get you
					into speed with building your layout. But you can
					always delete it if you are hardcore.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="span6">
				<h3>It's straightforward</h3>
				<p>
					Chief uses one to one mapping when translating URLs
					to actual functions. So, let's say you are accessing a page through the URL
					<code>www.example.com/blog/article/chief_is_great/</code>.
					Chief will try to find a module named <code>blog</code>
					(it's actually just a class), run a function named
					<code>article</code> in that class, passing rest of the
					arguments in the URL as parameters.
				</p>
				<p>
					You never have to define routes or try to figure out
					where the hell that request is shooting. Some people
					may not like things this simple, but they'll be busy
					arguing semantics while you'll be publishing your new
					shiny app and earning all the glory.
				</p>
				<hr class="soften">
				<h3>It speaks database</h3>
				<p>
					Chief offers tools for accessing the database in
					a simple but effective manner. There's no heavy
					object-relational mapping, just sensible helper
					functions that make manipulating the database a breeze.
					Currently Chief supports MySQL and MariaDB.
					What do you think about this:
				</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint language-php">$articles = $this->db->all("SELECT * FROM news");</pre>
				<p>Or this?</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint language-php">$this->db->insert('news', [
  'title'     => $title,
  'slug'      => Common::slug($title),
  'date'      => date('Y-m-d H:i:s'),
  'published' => isset($_POST['published']),
  'user_id'   => null
]);</pre>
				<hr class="soften">
				<h3>It has kick ass plugins</h3>
				<p>
					Chief has plugins that make creating tables and
					forms easier than ever. By utilizing method chaining and
					anonymous functions,
					defining your tables and forms in PHP actually becomes
					a viable option. Take a look at this:
				</p>
				
				<pre class="prettyprint language-php">$form = $this->plugin('form')
  ->setData($event)
  ->hidden('id')
  ->text('name', 'Event name')->required()
  ->date('date', 'Date')->dateFormat('n/j/Y')
  ->text('price', 'Admission price')->transform(function($p) {
    return number_format($p, 2, ',', '')
  })->width(50)->append('&euro;')
  ->submit('submit', 'Save event');
  
if($form->isSent()) {
  $errors = $form->setValues($_POST)->validate();
  if(empty($errors)) {
    # No errors, I'm gonna save this so hard!
  }
}
	
echo $form;</pre>
				<p>
					Holy crap that looks neat. Tables can be created
					just as easily. Chief also has an plugin for
					handling images. You are also welcome to create your own
					plugins and share them with others. Or don't.

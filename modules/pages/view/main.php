        <p>Chief has been successfully installed and you can start doing you magic. Have fun!</p>
        
        <p>Chief includes by default two helpful modules: <code>error</code> for showing friendly error
        messages and <code>pages</code> to serve static pages you might need. This page can be found at
        <code>modules/pages/view/main.php</code></p>
        
        <p>You can remove these modules if you really need to. Chief is designed to work with you, not
        the other way around.</p>
        
        <p>You can change the default entry point to your app via <code>system/config.php</code>.</p>
